# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis to kickstarter data to uncover trend
### Purpose
Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. The budget is over $10,000.
We will be using excel to organize,sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make that make a project's campaign successful.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We use parentcategory, “theater” to create pivot tables and graphing in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date.
Theater campaign outcomes on the Y axis and launch date on the X axis.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We use subcategory, “plays” to create graph to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.
Percentage outcomes on the Y axis and goal amount on the X axis.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We need to extreamly pay attention to details when copying data and using excel functions. One small mistake may cause the excel function unable to run or cause error in the date set, and eventually would lead to an incorrect data graph.
