# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis to kickstarter data to uncover trend
### Purpose
Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, Fever. The budget is over $10,000.
We will be using excel to organize,sort, and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make that make a project's campaign successful.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We use parentcategory, “theater” to create pivot tables and graphing in Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date.
Theater campaign outcomes are on the Y axis and launch dates are on the X axis.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We use subcategory, “plays” to create graph to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.
Percentage outcomes label on the Y axis and goal amount label on the X axis.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We need to extreamly pay attention to details when referencing data and using excel functions. One small mistake may cause the excel function unable to run or cause error in the date set, and eventually would lead to an incorrect data graph.
## Results
### Outcomes based on Launch Date
        Based on the Outcomes vs Launch dates graph, we can draw two conclusions.The first one is that we should allocate more resources to launch fundrasing campaigns in April and May. From our observations and analyses, we have 60% successful rate in April and 61% successful rate in May. There are total 426 successful outcomes in December.
        The second conclusion is that we should put fewer resources to lanuch fundraising campaigns in December. There is only 44% successul rate in December. It is the lowest successful rate throughout the year. There are only 111 successful outcomes in December.
